This is a copy of the local directory I used while working my way through Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way".

It includes all exercises completed so far, plus all personal notes and flat files necessary to run scripts from each exercise.  Note that not all .py files produce output.  

This repo also includes a .pdf copy of the book itself.  
The free HTTP version of the bookcan be found at http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
