Rules for If- Statements

1. Every if- statement must have an else.
2. If this else should never be run because it doesnâ€™t make sense, then you must use a die
function in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last
exercise. This will fi nd many errors.
3. Never nest if- statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
This means if you put an if in an if, then you should be looking to move that second if
into another function.
4. Treat if- statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like a
set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
5. Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables
earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
